Hi, I'm Jack Pierson!

I am currently an undergraduate sophomore at the California Institute of Technology studying Information/Data Science, Business Economics Management, and Computer Science.

My interests include sports analytics, finance, learning new programming languages, and trying to solve problems that I find intruiging.
